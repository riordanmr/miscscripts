    <p>Welcome, St. Maurice class of 1970! </p>
    <p>We are planning a reunion to be held on Aug 19, 2023 at the former St. Maurice Church (now St. Rafka)

        We hope you all can make it.  Here is the schedule of events:
    <ul>
        <li>3pm: tour of the former St. Maurice School, hosted by Starfish Early Childhood Education Center
            (which currently occupies the space).  Note: due to ongoing renovations, it is possible that
            the tour could be cancelled.</li>
        <li>4pm: <a href="https://www.saintrafkamichigan.com/">St. Rafka</a> will be holding their 
            <a href="https://www.saintrafkafestival.com/">annual festival</a> at the church during the reunion, 
            so there will be plenty of food, drink, and entertainment available. 
            Look for the table labeled St. Maurice Reunion.
